In this chapter we are going to look at 
how to control where each element sits 
on a page and how to create attractive 
page layouts.
This involves learning about how designing for a screen can be 
different to designing for other mediums (such as print). In this 
chapter we will:
● Explore different ways to position elements using normal 
flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning and floats.
● Discover how various devices have different screen sizes 
and resolution, and how this affects the design process.
● Learn the difference between fixed width and liquid layouts, 
and how they are created.
● Find out how designers use grids to make their page 
designs look more professional
